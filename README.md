On the nmon MASTER:
The nmon datacollect needs the following setup...

1) Directory layout

<nmonbase> - where the nmon data collect script will be kept
    - <nmonbin>/<nmonchrt>/nmonchart - nmon chart binary
               /<nmonmrg>/nmonmerge - nmon merge command is kept
    - <rawdata>/<hostname or ip>/*.nmon - nmon rawdata sample files are kept, this is collected every 5 minutes as per cron
    - <daydata>/<hostname>_<day>.nmon - merged nmon files are kept, 1 file per day
    - <nmonchartop>/<hostname or ip>/<day>.html - 1 file per day generated by nmon chart are kept
    - nmondatacollect_v1.ksh - nmon script collecting the data

2) List of binaries needed:
You should have nmcli, ksh, nmon, nmonmerge, nmonchart,nfs-utils binaries available

3) Cron entry as like below..

*/5 * * * * <nmonbase>/nmondatacollect_v1.ksh MASTER 30 9 ><nmonbase>/nmondatacollect_v1.out 2>&1

4) Remember this <nmonbase> should be a shared drive, where you will bring forward mutliple clients data in one place, which is then processed from MASTER.

5) For client, the cron will look like below..

*/5 * * * * <nmonbase>/nmondatacollect_v1.ksh CLIENT 30 ><nmonbase>/nmondatacollect_v1_<clientname>.out 2>&1

6) Also nfs export the nmonbase mount to be accessible from the clients who need access to it

On the nmon CLIENT:

1) Get the <nmonbase> directory remote mounted. If needed grant 777 permission to all the directory in the nmonbase.

2) Install ksh,nmcli,nmon,nfs-utils binary alone in the client server.

3) Create the below directory 

<nmonbase>/rawdata/<host ip>

3) Schedule the cron

*/5 * * * * /mnt/nmonclient/nmondata/nmondatacollect_v1.ksh CLIENT 30 >/mnt/nmonclient/nmondata/nmondatacollect_v1_<clientip>.out 2>&1  

4) Now the data should be populated and in 5 mins time you should see data available in the chart after 10 mins.
